# Machine Learning and ElasticSearch 
This term project was conducted in my Data Processing and Analytics class. My team I used ElasticSearch ELK and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio to discover insights and linear regressions with flu vaccination personnel data from the California department of public health open data website. Data set retrieved was for flu season 2017-2018.
